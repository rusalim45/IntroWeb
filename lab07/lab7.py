# Control Flow: Conditions in Python


# 1. if Statement
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You can come in")

# 2. else Statement
age = 16
if age >= 18:
    print("You can come in")
else:
    print("You can not come in")

# 3. elif (else if) Statement
age = 16
if age > 18:
    print("You can come in")
elif age == 18:
    print("We should check you passport")
else:
    print("You can not come in")

# 4. Nested if Statements
age = 20
has_ticket = True

if age >= 18:
    if has_ticket:
        print("You can come in")
    else:
        print("You can not come in without the ticket")
else:
    print("You can not come in because of age")

# 5. Conditional Expressions (Ternary Operator)
age = 16
result = "You can drive" if age >= 18 else "You can not drive"
print(result)

# 6. Combining Conditions
age = 20
has_ticket = True

if age >= 18 and has_ticket:
    print("You can come in")
else:
    print("You can not come")

# Control Flow: Loops in Python

# 1. for Loop
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Using range() with for Loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# Custom range
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)

# 2. while Loop
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

# 3. break Statement
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)

# 4. continue Statement
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)

# 5. else Clause with Loops
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop is completed")

# 6. Nested Loops
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")

# 7. Infinite Loop (stopped with break)
while True:
    print("This will run forever")
    break

# Practice Exercises

# 1
for i in range(10):
    print(i)

i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1

# 2
for i in "Python":
    print(i)

# 3
i = 2
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 2
